// In this snippet, the latestData object is initialized with flow and total properties set to 0. The handler function listens for POST requests and updates the latestData object with the new flow and total values received in the request body. The updated data is then logged to the console for confirmation. The latestData object is exported to make it accessible to other files, such as the data.js file that serves the latest data to clients. This separation of concerns allows for a clear distinction between updating and serving data, making the code more modular and maintainable.
